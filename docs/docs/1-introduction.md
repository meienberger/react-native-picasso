Heavily inspired by Bootstrap, React Native Picasso is a toolkit to help you create layouts for your React Native apps in a clear and declarative way.
No more ugly inline styles or duplicate stylesheets. You can now use classNames as you would do on the web.

Having a strong design system helps you to focus on functionnality instead of design fine tuning and endless replacements.

This will give your app a strong single source of truth. You declare your design system once and then consume it in each of your screens.
