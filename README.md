# react-native-picasso

This NOT yet another components library

Picasso is a toolkit to help you create layouts for your React Native apps in a clear and declarative way.
No more inline styles or duplicate stylesheets. You can now use classnames

This will give your app a strong single source of truth. You declare your design system once and then consume it in each of your screens.

<!-- This package was created in order to address the lack of any good package to declare layouts in react-native. -->

This was heavily inspired by Bootstrap
